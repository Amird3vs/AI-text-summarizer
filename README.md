# BrieflyAI: An AI-Powered Text Summarizer

BrieflyAI is an AI-powered text summarization application that efficiently transforms lengthy texts into concise summaries using state-of-the-art natural language processing. Initially developed during my Project-Based Learning at Postman Academy, I've recently enhanced its design and added new features for improved functionality.

## Features

- **Efficient Summarization**: Utilizes the facebook/bart-large-cnn model by Meta AI for accurate and informative summaries.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for personalized viewing.
- **Text Input Verification**: Ensures valid input length and enables or disables functionality based on input length.
- **Clipboard Functionality**: Allows pasting from clipboard for convenience.
- **Text Clearing with Confirmation**: Provides a confirmation dialog before clearing text areas.
